~~NOTE: As of late March 2024, there is an arithmetic overflow in the AUR package due to an upstream bug in how pacman handles .NET self-contained applications. 

~~Temporary fix is to set:~~

```
options=("!strip" "!debug")
```

~~in the PKGBUILD. Be sure to completely clean before rebuilding (an AUR helper cleanbuild is insufficient) if you have already had a failed install from the bug.~~~~

As of 30 April 2024 this appears to be fixed. See [[Git]] for general usage (need to rationalize these entries)
