# Freud 

## Primary

The go-to for reading Freud in English historically has been the *Standard Edition*, abbreviated *SE* in the literature. Indeed, the *SE* has a critical apparatus that was back-translated into the German *Gesammelte Werke* (*GW*). Recently, the *Revised Standard Edition* or *RSE* came out with some minor adjustments that probably aren't important unless you're a psychoanalyst or Freud scholar.

I tend to just read from the Norton paperback editions of the *SE* editions.
