# Primary

I usually read the *Gesamtausgabe* (*GA*) editions in German. 

Translations are notoriously tricky for Heidegger. More recent translations from the *Gesamtausgabe* by e.g. Indiana University Press are usually about as good as it's gonna get. At the opposite end of the spectrum, M&R's translation of *Being and Time* is notorious, but it's also been a standard for so long in Anglophone work that you should keep a copy around. Stambaugh's is better.

## Dreydegger

Hubert Dreyfus was hugely influential as a point of transmission for Heidegger to the Anglophone world (specifically, to the US). However, while his reading and those inspired by him are very interesting for bringing Heidegger-inspired themes into more mainstream Anglophone philosophy (e.g., philosophy of mind) they are very partial readings of Heidegger. Take them for what they are - their own thing - and they can be very interesting.
