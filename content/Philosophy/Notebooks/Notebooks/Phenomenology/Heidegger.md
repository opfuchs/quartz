# Primary

I usually read the *Gesamtausgabe* (*GA*) editions in German. 

Translations are notoriously tricky for Heidegger. More recent translations from the *Gesamtausgabe* by e.g. Indiana University Press are usually about as good as it's gonna get. At the opposite end of the spectrum, M&R's translation of *Being and Time* is notorious, but it's also been a standard for so long in Anglophone work that you should keep a copy around. Stambaugh's is better.

(Originally published in French in 1982 as *Le Principe d'anarchie : Heidegger et la question de l'agir*. Foucault said that this was the only secondary work on Heidegger worth reading - as of 1982, that wasn't too much of an exaggeration.)
