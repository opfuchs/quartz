Inspired by Cosma Shalizi's [famous notebooks](http://bactra.org/notebooks/), although I disagree with him strongly about some subjects (especially in philosophy)

Where possible I have put the English translation of a work if it's available. However, I can't claim I've been perfect about this, as except for doing scholarly interpretations where the original language matters (e.g., on Deleuze or Nietzsche etc.) I'll read whichever - original vs. English - is more conveniently available for me, at least for the languages I can read (English, French, German, Italian).
