Welcome! It looks like you've stumbled into my personal garden. Browse around for the various infosec notes, writeups, and more of a hacker fox ðŸ¦Š. Check out the Explorer menu or search to get started!

IF YOU DON'T SEE THE CONTENT EXPLORER ON THE LEFT ON DESKTOP: As of 30 April 2024, there's a problem - which I haven't had time to debug - where a desktop browser will be detected as mobile at >=100% zoom, so the explorer/table of contents does not appear on the left as it should. I hope to get this fixed soon, but in the meantime, just zoom out a bit if you don't see it. This seems to be an upstream problem affecting certain client setups (including mine).

Dark mode recommended.
