Various tips

* Malware often checks the flag field within the `ProcessHeap` struct, by seeing if `HEAP_GROWABLE` bit 2 is set (debugged). `ForceFlags` is usually compared w/ 0, so `!0` if debugged.
* Can raise debugger exceptions like `DBG_CONTROL_C`, `DBG_CONTROL_BREAK`, or `DBG_RIPEVENT` with `RaiseException`, `RtlRaiseException`, or `NtRaiseException` to attach debugger if the malware's own exception handlers fail to take control.
